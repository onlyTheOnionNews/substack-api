# Samples

This directory contains example applications that demonstrate how to use the Substack API client library.

## Running the Example

### Option 1: Using environment variables

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the project root:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` and add your Substack API credentials:
   ```
   SUBSTACK_TOKEN=your-token-here
   SUBSTACK_PUBLICATION_URL=your-publication.substack.com
   ```

3. Run the sample:
   ```bash
   npm run sample
   ```

### Option 2: Interactive mode

If you don't have a `.env` file, the sample will prompt you for credentials:

```bash
npm run sample
```

## What the Example Demonstrates

The `index.ts` example showcases the following features:

1. **🔐 Authentication** - Connecting with token and publication URL
2. **📡 Connectivity Testing** - Verifying the API connection works
3. **👤 Profile Management** - Fetching your own profile information
4. **📰 Content Fetching** - Listing recent posts with titles and metadata
5. **📝 Notes Management** - Retrieving and displaying recent notes
6. **🤝 Social Features** - Listing users you follow
